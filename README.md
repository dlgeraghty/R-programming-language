Learning the R programming language

+ Tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3FozVfd7q4
+ Okay , I feel like explaining what is my setup here:
	+ SO: ArchLinux
	+ R (from yay)
	+ Dataset: beaver1 ( for the moment, as the one provided in the tutorial I follow is wrong and I dont feel like fixing it now)
	+ Edit a plain file with vim or your favourite text editor
	+ Run that file with Rscript file.r
